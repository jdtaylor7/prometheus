Prometheus is a real-time drone monitoring application. Built with OpenGL, it
allows one to easily visualize the telemetry from a drone system. It runs under
X11 and is supported on Arch Linux and Ubuntu Focal.

# Dependencies

Some dependencies are included in the source directory, but a few must be
installed locally. Those which must be installed locally are:

* CMake
* OpenGL
* GLFW
* Assimp

### Arch Linux

The above dependencies can be installed on Arch Linux via the following packages
from the official Arch Linux repositories:

```
sudo pacman -Syu base-devel cmake glfw-x11 assimp
```

### Ubuntu Focal (20.04LTS)

The following packages are required on Ubuntu:

```
sudo apt install cmake libgl1-mesa-dev libglfw3 libglfw3-dev libassimp-dev
```

# Building

Prometheus is built with [CMake](https://cmake.org/) via a build script:

```
./build.sh -e prometheus
```

# Running

Run the binary from the root project directory:

```
./build/prometheus
```

At the moment some file path names are relative so running from the build
directory itself will not work.

# Demo

This demo features the display of drone data in real time. The drone position
and orientation data, as plotted on the left side of the screen, is being
generated by an Arduino board connected via `/dev/ttyACM0` (as shown on the
right side of the screen). The Arduino sketch is that specified in
`test/hardware/arduino_ground_station/arduino_ground_station.ino`.
